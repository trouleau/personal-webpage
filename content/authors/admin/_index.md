I'm an Engagement Lead & Data Scientist at [Unit8](https://unit8.com) where I use data and machine learning to solve hands-on business challenges. I work on the whole journey from design, to implementation and deployment of AI-based systems for customers in the chemical industry spanning different business units: from innovation, to compliance or manufacturing.

In 2021, I earned a PhD from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/) in Lausanne, Switzerland. My research was focused on the statistical and algorithmic aspects of modeling, control, and inference of networks of times series ; with applications in epidemiology, neuroscience, information diffusion and recommendation systems. 

During my PhD, I was an intern at the [Institute for Disease Modeling](https://www.idmod.org) in Seattle, quantifying the burden of Tuberculosis in Pakistan. I also had the opportunity to intern at Technicolor in the Silicon Valley.
